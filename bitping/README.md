## How Earnings Work

Earnings on Bitping are calculated on a per-job basis. Each task you complete contributes directly to your earnings. Several factors influence how much you earn from each job:

1. **Geographic location**: Jobs are segmented by continent, country, and city. The demand for testing varies significantly between regions, affecting job distribution and pay rates.

2. **Proxy status**: Whether your node is behind a proxy/VPN can impact your potential earnings.

3. **Residential status**: If your node is reachable on a residential IP address, this can affect your earnings potential.

4. **Demand for work**: Some regions have a higher demand for network testing services, which can lead to higher payments and more frequent jobs.

**Note**: Job distribution isn't always even across the network due to varying demands and specific client requirements. However, the node selection algorithm randomly selects nodes based on job criteria to ensure fairness within a region.

## Strategies to Increase Earnings

To maximize your earnings on Bitping, consider the following strategies:

1. **Diversify your IP addresses**: Access to more unique IP addresses, especially in highly requested countries, can significantly increase the number of jobs you can accept and complete.

2. **Optimize your setup**: Ensure your internet connection and hardware setup are reliable and meet the requirements of high-demand jobs. This can increase your chances of receiving more lucrative tasks. You can check your node status in the Bitping Dashboard.
